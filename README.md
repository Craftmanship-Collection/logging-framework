## Overview

This repository contains implementations of a Logging Framework in Java, designed to help with Low-Level Design (LLD) preparation and interviews. Each branch represents a different team member's solution to the logging framework problem.
## Repository Structure
The repository is organized into three branches, each containing a different implementation of the logging framework:

* ```logging/lynx```
* ```logging/pavan```
* ```logging/manoj```

## Purpose
This repository serves as a learning resource for:

* Understanding different approaches to logging framework design
* Practicing Low-Level Design (LLD) concepts
* Preparing for technical interviews focusing on system design
* Comparing different implementations of the same problem
