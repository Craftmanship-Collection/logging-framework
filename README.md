## Overview

This repository contains implementations of a Logging Framework in Java, designed to help with Low-Level Design (LLD) preparation and interviews. Each branch represents a different team member's solution to the logging framework problem.
## Repository Structure
The repository is organized into three branches, each containing a different implementation of the logging framework:

* ```logging/lynx```
* ```logging/pavan```
* ```logging/manoj```

## Purpose
This repository serves as a learning resource for:

* Understanding different approaches to logging framework design
* Practicing Low-Level Design (LLD) concepts
* Preparing for technical interviews focusing on system design
* Comparing different implementations of the same problem

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Java JDK 11 or higher
* Maven or Gradle (based on the implementation)

### Running the Examples


* **Clone the repository**

    ```bash 
    git clone https://github.com/Craftmanship-Collection/logging-framework/
    cd logging-framework
    ```
* **Switch to a specific member's solution branch**
    ```bash
    git checkout <<member-branch>>
    ```
Follow the specific instructions in each branch's README for building and running that particular solution
